## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The first time using Tailwind CSS, allowing for easy addition of styles to individual elements within a component. It's also convenient to combine it with CSS for further customization. I have the flexibility to customize any style that is not present in the default configuration.
